# AustinAirbnb

This project analyzes Airbnb rental prices across different zip codes in the Austin area. Using data visualization techniques with Seaborn, I explored how price distributions vary by location. The goal was to identify key pricing patterns and trends to provide insights for both potential renters and hosts. The analysis includes comparisons of average prices, price ranges, and correlations between price and various location-related factors.
